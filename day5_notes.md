### `Static Behavior Evaluation ‚Äî CMOS Inverter Robustness ‚Äî Power Supply Variation`

**Overview:**

The **static behavior** of a CMOS inverter is highly influenced by variations in its power supply. Changes in `Vdd` impact the **switching threshold (Vm)**, **noise margins**, and **overall robustness** of the circuit. These characteristics are critical for low-power CMOS design, especially in scaled technology nodes.

### `Smart SPICE Simulation for Power Supply Variation`

In this section, a **Smart SPICE simulation** is performed to analyze the effect of different power supply voltages on the CMOS inverter's **Voltage Transfer Characteristics (VTC)**.

- The inverter is simulated at various `Vdd` values ranging from **2.5V down to 1V**.
- Device parameters remain constant:
  - `Wp = 0.9375 Œºm`
  - `Wn = 0.375 Œºm`

**Observation:**

- As the supply voltage decreases, the **switching threshold (Vm)** moves toward the middle of the supply range.
- **Noise margins** reduce due to the smaller voltage swing.
- The **output transition region** becomes narrower at lower `Vdd`.

### `Advantages and Disadvantages of Using Low Supply Voltage`

‚úÖ **Advantages:**
- **Reduced power dissipation** due to the quadratic dependency of dynamic power on `Vdd` (P ‚àù Vdd¬≤).
- **Improved energy efficiency**, suitable for low-power applications.
- Enhanced **gain efficiency** (~50% improvement) for small-signal operation.

‚ùå **Disadvantages:**
- **Reduced noise immunity**, causing higher sensitivity to voltage fluctuations.
- **Decreased performance**, as lower `Vdd` reduces the transistor drive strength.
- **Limited switching speed**, making the circuit slower for high-frequency operations.

The figure below illustrates how the **VTC curve** shifts with different supply voltages, highlighting the trade-off between **power efficiency** and **noise robustness**.

## Static Behavior Evaluation ‚Äî CMOS Inverter Robustness ‚Äî Device Variation

#### Overview:
- Device variations are inevitable in semiconductor fabrication and can significantly affect the robustness and performance of CMOS inverters. The two major sources of such variations are etching process variation and oxide thickness variation.

#### Source of Variation ‚Äî Etching Process

- The etching process defines the physical dimensions of the transistor such as Width (W) and Length (L).
- During fabrication, dimensional deviations occur between the designed and actual geometry.

##### These variations impact:
- Transistor current (Id)
- Switching threshold (Vm)
- Noise margins
- Delay and robustness

This image illustrates etching variation, showing discrepancies between the ideal mask and the fabricated structure.

##### Impact:
Deviation in W/L ratio changes drive strength, leading to mismatched inverter characteristics across a chip.


### Source of Variation ‚Äî Oxide Thickness

- The oxide thickness (Tox) directly affects the gate capacitance (Cox).

##### Variations in Tox lead to fluctuations in:
- Threshold voltage (Vth)
- Drain current (Id)
- Inverter delay and noise margins
As shown below, minor variations in oxide thickness during fabrication can cause significant changes in device performance.

### Smart SPICE Simulation for Device Variations

- In this simulation, PMOS and NMOS widths are varied to study their effect on inverter characteristics.

##### Observation:
- When PMOS width > NMOS width, the inverter exhibits a stronger pull-up (output stays high longer).
- When NMOS width > PMOS width, the inverter exhibits a stronger pull-down (output falls faster).

### Conclusion

- Etching and oxide variations are major contributors to CMOS performance shifts.
- Variations alter Vth, Id, and Vm, leading to non-uniform switching across inverters.
- Robust CMOS design requires process-aware simulation and device sizing to ensure consistent noise margins and stability.
- Understanding these variations is key to improving manufacturing yield and circuit reliability in scaled nodes.

As the PMOS width is larger than the NMOS width, the PMOS provides a stronger pull-up path ‚Äî keeping the output high for longer durations, demonstrating device strength asymmetry in inverter response.
