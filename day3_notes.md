### `Voltage Transfer Characteristics â€” SPICE Simulations`

#### SPICE Deck Creation for CMOS Inverter

This section demonstrates how to construct a **SPICE deck** for a CMOS inverter using the Sky130 PDK.

- **Transistor Connectivity:** Define PMOS (M1) and NMOS (M2) connections with `Vdd`, `Vin`, `Vout`, and ground.
- **Parameter Definition:** Specify transistor dimensions, supply voltage (1.8 V), and load capacitance.
- **Node Naming:** Assign unique node names (`in`, `out`, `vdd`, `vss`) to simplify simulation tracking.
- **Model Inclusion:** Include Sky130 model files to ensure realistic simulation behavior.

This setup forms the foundation for accurate **CMOS inverter simulations**.

#### SPICE Simulation for CMOS Inverter

Once the SPICE deck is prepared, DC and transient simulations are performed.

- **DC Sweep (`.dc`)** â€” Used to obtain **Voltage Transfer Characteristics (VTC)** by sweeping `Vin` from 0 V â†’ 1.8 V.
- **Transient (`.tran`)** â€” Used to observe **dynamic behavior** such as rise and fall delays.

Simulation parameters include:
- `Vdd = 1.8 V`
- `Cload = 50 fF`
- Transistor dimensions: `Wp = 0.84 Âµm`, `Wn = 0.36 Âµm`, `L = 0.15 Âµm`

## Static Behavior Evaluation â€” CMOS Inverter Robustness â€” Switching Threshold

### Switching Threshold (Vm)

- The Switching Threshold Voltage (Vm) is the point where Vin = Vout.
- At Vm, both NMOS and PMOS operate in saturation, contributing equally to current flow.
- This determines noise margins and overall inverter robustness.

### Analytical Expression of Vm as a Function of (W/L)p and (W/L)n

- At the switching threshold, current balance condition holds:

![Static_behavior](Screenshots/Vm1.png)
![Static_behavior](Screenshots/Vm2.png)
![Static_behavior](Screenshots/Vm3.png)

This expression relates Vm to device parameters and mobility ratios.

### Analytical Expression of (W/L)p and (W/L)n as a Function of Vm

- From the same condition, the required sizing ratio can be derived:

![Static_behavior](Screenshots/WL2.png)
![Static_behavior](Screenshots/WL3.png)
![Static_behavior](Screenshots/WL4.png)
![Static_behavior](Screenshots/WL5.png)

This equation helps determine the optimal PMOS/NMOS width ratio for a desired Vm.

### Static and Dynamic Simulation of CMOS Inverter

By running both .dc (static) and .tran (dynamic) simulations:
- Static analysis shows VTC and switching threshold.
- Dynamic analysis provides rise/fall times, propagation delays, and signal integrity data.

### Static and Dynamic Simulation with Increased PMOS Width

When PMOS width is increased:
- Rise delay decreases due to higher pull-up strength.
- Switching threshold (Vm) shifts toward higher voltage.
- Achieves balanced rise/fall delays improving clock signal symmetry.

### Application of CMOS Inverter in Clock Network and STA:
- Inverters are widely used as clock buffers in digital ICs.
- Balanced rise and fall delays ensure duty cycle accuracy and timing closure in Static Timing Analysis (STA).
- Mismatch in PMOS/NMOS drive strengths can cause duty cycle distortion, which can be corrected through buffer sizing and STA optimization.

### âœ… Conclusion

Through detailed SPICE simulations and theoretical analysis:
- Switching Threshold Voltage (Vm) defines inverter stability and noise margins.
- Proper sizing of PMOS/NMOS transistors balances rise/fall delays.
- Velocity saturation and channel length effects impact device drive current and switching efficiency.
- In clock networks, optimized inverters ensure timing accuracy and low power operation.
- The CMOS inverter thus serves as the fundamental building block for high-performance, power-efficient digital circuits in modern VLSI design.
